#Hi everyone.

Thanks for clicking on that enticing "blog" link on my main page.
This is my blog. Over time, I'll be updating it with ideas, development diaries, and other relatively interesting information.

###A few things about me first:

* I am one semester away from finishing a philosophy degree at Kenyon College.
* Next semester, I'll be taking courses on Postmodernism, Arduino Programming, and Max/MSP. Expect to hear a lot more about those soon.
* Most often, I wear collared shirts.
* I don't need glasses, but I still often wonder whether or not I should get them.


Stay tuned for more updates.
